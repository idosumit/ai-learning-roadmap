# AI Learning Roadmap

This is a repository where I document my AI learning; so it's basically a roadmap -- a very long-term one. It starts from the absolute zero, and the aim is to reach the level of a practitioner, one step at a time. For somebody without any AI background and a very basic understanding of programming and Math, this might offer some rough timeline. 

#

> [!NOTE]
> This is an ever-updating list, since I'll keep updating it as I up the levels of difficulty gradually based on my dedicated learning, but maybe somebody might join me on this long journey. Or I might just always be talking to myself. Dunno. Either way, I'll keep on updating this repo.

#

> [!IMPORTANT]
> My Current Self-Proclaimed Level: **`AMATEUR`**

My plan is to reach semi-advanced level in 1.5 years with at least 2 hours of studying every day and 15 hours of studying every week. I'm a working adult, so this is all I can muster.

## Roadmap

### Beginner & Amateur
#### Math
- [Math for ML Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning): Covers basic linear algebra, calculus, and statistics required for ML.
  - basic fundamental understanding only, which I consider super important since being able to understand the mathematical intuition is super important, even if it's just a basic one.
  - [x] Linear Algebra Course
  - [ ] Calculus Course
  - [ ] Probability and Statistics Course
<br>

- - [ ] [Essence of Linear Algebra YouTube playlist by 3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

#### AI Stuff
- - [ ] [Neural Network Essence playlist by 3B1B](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks)
  - More of a visual explanation of things to introduce us to the neural network etymoloy & give us the hang of things behind their fundamentals.
<br>

- - [x] [Intro to Neural Networks and Backpropagation through Micrograd, by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&pp=ygUJbWljcm9ncmFk)
  - A proper "learn by getting your hands dirty" kind of a project
  - Dude builds a simple neural network from scratch and explains everything behind it. Very intuitive course.
  - Usage of simple calculus, requires basic understanding of Python. I'm like a kindergartener in Python, and it's pretty funny that I learned the language more as I did this! Very doable.
  - [This is my implementation of the project](https://github.com/idosumit/micrograd)
<br>

- - [ ] MNIST Digit Recognizer Project
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)
 
#### Programming (Python, PyTorch, etc.)
